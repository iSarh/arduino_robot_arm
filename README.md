# Controlling a Robot Arm: Joint State Publisher, Moveit, and Kinematics

In this repository, I will detail the process of controlling a robot arm using ROS (Robot Operating System), specifically focusing on three key components: Joint State Publisher, Moveit, and kinematics. These tools are essential for simulating, planning, and executing movements for robotic arms in a virtual environment.

## Forking the Repository
I began by forking the original arduino_robot_arm repository from [smart-methods] to my own GitHub account. This repository provides a foundation for controlling a robotic arm, integrating hardware control and simulation capabilities using ROS.

## Setup Environment
**Operating System and ROS Version**
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS Version: ROS Noetic

## Requirements
1. Preparing ROS
Create a workspace by using >catkin_make http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace 

2.
